In the process, the Monte Carlo method generated 1% percentiles of ten-day returns. The ten-day returns were calculated based on the one-day returns given by a stable distribution with	the	
following	parameters:	alpha	=	1.7;	beta	=	0.0;	gamma	=	1.0;	delta	=	1.0.
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov fit test is used for the two generated percentile samples in the construction of the percentile distribution.
